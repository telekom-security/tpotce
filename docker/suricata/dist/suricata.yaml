  # Packet log... log packets in pcap format. 3 modes of operation: "normal"
  # "multi" and "sguil".
  #
  # In normal mode a pcap file "filename" is created in the default-log-dir,
  # or as specified by "dir".
  # In multi mode, a file is created per thread. This will perform much
  # better, but will create multiple files where 'normal' would create one.
  # In multi mode the filename takes a few special variables:
  # - %n -- thread number
  # - %i -- thread id
  # - %t -- timestamp (secs or secs.usecs based on 'ts-format'
  # E.g. filename: pcap.%n.%t
  #
  # Note that it's possible to use directories, but the directories are not
  # created by Suricata. E.g. filename: pcaps/%n/log.%s will log into the
  # per thread directory.
  #
  # Also note that the limit and max-files settings are enforced per thread.
  # So the size limit when using 8 threads with 1000mb files and 2000 files
  # is: 8*1000*2000 ~ 16TiB.
  #
  # In Sguil mode "dir" indicates the base directory. In this base dir the
  # pcaps are created in the directory structure Sguil expects:
  #
  # $sguil-base-dir/YYYY-MM-DD/$filename.<timestamp>

## Step 3: Configure common capture settings
##
## See "Advanced Capture Options" below for more options, including Netmap
## and PF_RING.
##

# Linux high speed capture support
af-packet:
  - interface: eth0
    # Number of receive threads. "auto" uses the number of cores
    #threads: auto
    # Default clusterid. AF_PACKET will load balance packets based on flow.
    cluster-id: 99
    # Default AF_PACKET cluster type. AF_PACKET can load balance per flow or per hash.
    # This is only supported for Linux kernel > 3.1
    # possible value are:
    #  * cluster_flow: all packets of a given flow are sent to the same socket
    #  * cluster_cpu: all packets treated in kernel by a CPU are sent to the same socket
    #  * cluster_qm: all packets linked by network card to a RSS queue are sent to the same
    #  socket. Requires at least Linux 3.14.
    #  * cluster_ebpf: eBPF file load balancing. See doc/userguide/capture-hardware/ebpf-xdp.rst for
    #  more info.
    # Recommended modes are cluster_flow on most boxes and cluster_cpu or cluster_qm on system
    # with capture card using RSS (requires cpu affinity tuning and system IRQ tuning)
    cluster-type: cluster_flow
    # In some fragmentation cases, the hash can not be computed. If "defrag" is set
    # to yes, the kernel will do the needed defragmentation before sending the packets.
    defrag: yes
    # To use the ring feature of AF_PACKET, set 'use-mmap' to yes
    #use-mmap: yes
    # Lock memory map to avoid it being swapped. Be careful that over
    # subscribing could lock your system
    #mmap-locked: yes
    # Use tpacket_v3 capture mode, only active if use-mmap is true
    # Don't use it in IPS or TAP mode as it causes severe latency
    #tpacket-v3: yes
    # Ring size will be computed with respect to "max-pending-packets" and number
    # of threads. You can set manually the ring size in number of packets by setting
    # the following value. If you are using flow "cluster-type" and have really network
    # intensive single-flow you may want to set the "ring-size" independently of the number
    # of threads:
    #ring-size: 2048
    # Block size is used by tpacket_v3 only. It should set to a value high enough to contain
    # a decent number of packets. Size is in bytes so please consider your MTU. It should be
    # a power of 2 and it must be multiple of page size (usually 4096).
    #block-size: 32768
    # tpacket_v3 block timeout: an open block is passed to userspace if it is not
    # filled after block-timeout milliseconds.
    #block-timeout: 10
    # On busy systems, set it to yes to help recover from a packet drop
    # phase. This will result in some packets (at max a ring flush) not being inspected.
    #use-emergency-flush: yes
    # recv buffer size, increased value could improve performance
    # buffer-size: 32768
    # Set to yes to disable promiscuous mode
    # disable-promisc: no
    # Choose checksum verification mode for the interface. At the moment
    # of the capture, some packets may have an invalid checksum due to
    # the checksum computation being offloaded to the network card.
    # Possible values are:
    #  - kernel: use indication sent by kernel for each packet (default)
    #  - yes: checksum validation is forced
    #  - no: checksum validation is disabled
    #  - auto: Suricata uses a statistical approach to detect when
    #  checksum off-loading is used.
    # Warning: 'capture.checksum-validation' must be set to yes to have any validation
    #checksum-checks: kernel
    # BPF filter to apply to this interface. The pcap filter syntax applies here.
    #bpf-filter: port 80 or udp
    # You can use the following variables to activate AF_PACKET tap or IPS mode.
    # If copy-mode is set to ips or tap, the traffic coming to the current
    # interface will be copied to the copy-iface interface. If 'tap' is set, the
    # copy is complete. If 'ips' is set, the packet matching a 'drop' action
    # will not be copied.
    #copy-mode: ips

      #            or hardware if possible.
      # - full:    keep tracking and inspection as normal. Unmodified content

# Flow settings:
# By default, the reserved memory (memcap) for flows is 32MB. This is the limit
# for flow allocation inside the engine. You can change this value to allow
# more memory usage for flows.
# The hash-size determines the size of the hash used to identify flows inside
# the engine, and by default the value is 65536.
# At startup, the engine can preallocate a number of flows, to get better
# performance. The number of flows preallocated is 10000 by default.
# emergency-recovery is the percentage of flows that the engine needs to
# prune before clearing the emergency state. The emergency state is activated
# when the memcap limit is reached, allowing new flows to be created, but
# pruning them with the emergency timeouts (they are defined below).
# If the memcap is reached, the engine will try to prune flows
# with the default timeouts. If it doesn't find a flow to prune, it will set
# the emergency bit and it will try again with more aggressive timeouts.
# If that doesn't work, then it will try to kill the oldest flows using
# last time seen flows.
# The memcap can be specified in kb, mb, gb.  Just a number indicates it's
# in bytes.

# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each
# protocol. The value of "new" determines the seconds to wait after a handshake or
# stream startup before the engine frees the data of that flow it doesn't
# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if that time elapses
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero). "bypassed"
# timeout controls locally bypassed flows. For these flows we don't do any other
# tracking. If no packets have been seen after this timeout, the flow is discarded.
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables
# use the prefix "emergency-" and work similar as the normal ones.

## Performance tuning and profiling
##

# The detection engine builds internal groups of signatures. The engine
# allows us to specify the profile to use for them, to manage memory in an
# efficient way keeping good performance. For the profile keyword you
# can use the words "low", "medium", "high" or "custom". If you use custom,
# make sure to define the values in the "custom-values" section.
# Usually you would prefer medium/high/low.
#
# "sgh mpm-context", indicates how the staging should allot mpm contexts for
# the signature groups.  "single" indicates the use of a single context for
# all the signature group heads.  "full" indicates a mpm-context for each
# group head.  "auto" lets the engine decide the distribution of contexts
# based on the information the engine gathers on the patterns from each
# group head.
#
# The option inspection-recursion-limit is used to limit the recursive calls
# in the content inspection code.  For certain payload-sig combinations, we
# might end up taking too much time in the content inspection code.
# If the argument specified is 0, the engine uses an internally defined
# default limit.  When a value is not specified, there are no limits on the recursion.

## Netfilter integration
##

# When running in NFQ inline mode, it is possible to use a simulated
# non-terminal NFQUEUE verdict.
# This permits sending all needed packet to Suricata via this rule:
#        iptables -I FORWARD -m mark ! --mark $MARK/$MASK -j NFQUEUE
# And below, you can have your standard filtering ruleset. To activate
# this mode, you need to set mode to 'repeat'
# If you want a packet to be sent to another queue after an ACCEPT decision
# set the mode to 'route' and set next-queue value.
# On Linux >= 3.1, you can set batchcount to a value > 1 to improve performance
# by processing several packets before sending a verdict (worker runmode only).
# On Linux >= 3.6, you can set the fail-open option to yes to have the kernel
# accept the packet if Suricata is not able to keep pace.
# bypass mark and mask can be used to implement NFQ bypass. If bypass mark is
# set then the NFQ bypass is activated. Suricata will set the bypass mark/mask
# on packet of a flow that need to be bypassed. The Nefilter ruleset has to
# directly accept all packets of a flow once a packet has been marked.

   # You can use the following variables to activate netmap tap or IPS mode.
   # If copy-mode is set to ips or tap, the traffic coming to the current
   # interface will be copied to the copy-iface interface. If 'tap' is set, the
   # copy is complete. If 'ips' is set, the packet matching a 'drop' action
   # will not be copied.
   # To specify the OS as the copy-iface (so the OS can route packets, or forward
   # to a service running on the same machine) add a plus sign at the end
   # (e.g. "copy-iface: eth0+"). Don't forget to set up a symmetrical eth0+ -> eth0
   # for return packets. Hardware checksumming must be *off* on the interface if
   # using an OS endpoint (e.g. 'ifconfig eth0 -rxcsum -txcsum -rxcsum6 -txcsum6' for FreeBSD
   # or 'ethtool -K eth0 tx off rx off' for Linux).

# For FreeBSD ipfw(8) divert(4) support.
# Please make sure you have ipfw_load="YES" and ipdivert_load="YES"
# in /etc/loader.conf or kldload'ing the appropriate kernel modules.
# Additionally, you need to have an ipfw rule for the engine to see
# the packets from ipfw.  For Example:
#
#   ipfw add 100 divert 8000 ip from any to any
#
# N.B. This example uses "8000" -- this number must mach the values
# you passed on the command line, i.e., -d 8000
#
ipfw:

  # Reinject packets at the specified ipfw rule number.  This config
  # option is the ipfw rule number AT WHICH rule processing continues
  # in the ipfw processing system after the engine has finished
  # inspecting the packet for acceptance.  If no rule number is specified,
  # accepted packets are reinjected at the divert rule which they entered
  # and IPFW rule processing continues.  No check is done to verify
  # this will rule makes sense so care must be taken to avoid loops in ipfw.
  #
  ## The following example tells the engine to reinject packets
  # back into the ipfw firewall AT rule number 5500:
  #
  # ipfw-reinjection-rule-number: 5500

    # When use_all_streams is set to "yes" the initialization code will query
    # the Napatech service for all configured streams and listen on all of them.
    # When set to "no" the streams config array will be used.

    # This option necessitates running the appropriate NTPL commands to create
    # the desired streams prior to running Suricata.
    #use-all-streams: no

    # The streams to listen on when auto-config is disabled or when and threading
    # cpu-affinity is disabled.  This can be either:
    #   an individual stream (e.g. streams: [0])
    # or
    #   a range of streams (e.g. streams: ["0-3"])
    #
    streams: ["0-3"]

    # Stream stats can be enabled to provide fine grain packet and byte counters

    # When auto-config is enabled the streams will be created and assigned
    # automatically to the NUMA node where the thread resides.  If cpu-affinity
    # is enabled in the threading section.  Then the streams will be created
    # according to the number of worker threads specified in the worker-cpu-set.
    # Otherwise, the streams array is used to define the streams.
    #
    # This option is intended primarily to support legacy configurations.

    # Ports indicates which Napatech ports are to be used in auto-config mode.
    # these are the port IDs of the ports that will be merged prior to the
    # traffic being distributed to the streams.
    #
    # When hardware-bypass is enabled the ports must be configured as a segment.
    # specify the port(s) on which upstream and downstream traffic will arrive.
    # This information is necessary for the hardware to properly process flows.
    #
    # When using a tap configuration one of the ports will receive inbound traffic
    # for the network and the other will receive outbound traffic. The two ports on a
    # given segment must reside on the same network adapter.
    #
    # When using a SPAN-port configuration the upstream and downstream traffic
    # arrives on a single port. This is configured by setting the two sides of the
    # segment to reference the same port.  (e.g. 0-0 to configure a SPAN port on
    # port 0).
    #
    # port segments are specified in the form:
    #    ports: [0-1,2-3,4-5,6-6,7-7]
    #
    # For legacy systems when hardware-bypass is disabled this can be specified in any
    # of the following ways:
    #
    #   a list of individual ports (e.g. ports: [0,1,2,3])
    #
    #   a range of ports (e.g. ports: [0-3])
    #
    #   "all" to indicate that all ports are to be merged together
    #   (e.g. ports: [all])
    #
    # This parameter has no effect if auto-config is disabled.
    #
    ports: [0-1,2-3]

    # When auto-config is enabled the hashmode specifies the algorithm for
    # determining to which stream a given packet is to be delivered.
    # This can be any valid Napatech NTPL hashmode command.
    #
    # The most common hashmode commands are:  hash2tuple, hash2tuplesorted,
    # hash5tuple, hash5tuplesorted and roundrobin.
