# ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic support information (commands are expected to run as `root`)

**We happily take the time to improve T-Pot and take care of things, but we need you to take the time to create an issue that provides us with all the information we need.** 

- What OS are you T-Pot running on?
- What is the version of the OS `lsb_release -a` and `uname -a`?
- What T-Pot version are you currently using (only **T-Pot 24.04.x** is currently supported)?
- What architecture are you running on (i.e. hardware, cloud, VM, etc.)?
- Review the `~/install_tpot.log`, attach the log and highlight the errors.
- How long has your installation been running?
  - If it is a fresh install consult the documentation first.
  - Most likely it is a port conflict or a remote dependency was unavailable.
  - Retry a fresh installation and only open the issue if the error keeps coming up and is not resolved using the documentation as described [here](#how-to-raise-an-issue).  
- Did you install upgrades, packages or use the update script?
- Did you modify any scripts or configs? If yes, please attach the changes.
- Please provide a screenshot of `htop` and `docker stats`.
- How much free disk space is available (`df -h`)?
- What is the current container status (`dps`)?
- On Linux: What is the status of the T-Pot service (`systemctl status tpot`)?
- What ports are being occupied? Stop T-Pot `systemctl stop tpot` and run `grc netstat -tulpen`
  - Stop T-Pot `systemctl stop tpot`
  - Run `grc netstat -tulpen`
  - Run T-Pot manually with `docker compose -f ~/tpotce/docker-compose.yml up` and check for errors
  - Stop execution with `CTRL-C` and `docker compose -f ~/tpotce/docker-compose.yml down -v`
- If a single container shows as `DOWN` you can run `docker logs <container-name>` for the latest log entries
